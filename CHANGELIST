1.0.19 working recursive sync (sync specified dataset and all child datasets, ie pool/ds, pool/ds/1, pool, ds/1/a, pool/ds/2 ...) with --recursive or -r in syncoid!

1.0.18 updated syncoid to break sync out of main routine and into syncdataset(). this will allow doing recursive sync, in next update :)

1.0.17 updated syncoid to use sudo when necessary if it isn't already root - working user needs NOPASSWD for /sbin/zfs in /etc/sudoers
       updated syncoid to throw errors on unknown arguments

1.0.16 updated sanoid to use VASTLY improved CLI argument parsing, throw errors on unknown arguments, etc

1.0.15 updated syncoid to accept compression engine flags - --compress=lzo|gzip|none

1.0.14 updated syncoid to reduce output when fetching snapshot list - thank you github user @0xFate. 

1.0.13 removed monitor_version again - sorry for the feature instability, forgot I removed it in the first place because I didn't like pulling
       in so many dependencies for such a trivial feature

1.0.12 patched default sanoid.conf provided to set yearly_mon and yearly_mday correctly

1.0.11 patched bug in yearly snapshots - thank you @stevenolen for the bug report!

1.0.10 added --monitor-version to check installed version against current version in trunk on GitHub

1.0.9 added CR/LF after --monitor-health message output to make CLI usage cleaner looking

1.0.8 added --version checking in sanoid and syncoid

1.0.7 got rid of unnecessary sudo commands in sanoid's --monitor-health

1.0.6 added 'or die' to make sure /var/cache/sanoidsnapshots.txt is writeable

1.0.5 fixed another ps BSD-ism bug in sanoid

1.0.4 updated ps usage in sanoid to comply with BSDisms

1.0.3 nerfed references to $debug (not implemented yet) in sanoid

1.0.2 implemented iszfsbusy check to the thinning routine in sanoid

1.0.1 ported slightly modified iszfsbusy sub from syncoid to sanoid (to keep from thinning snapshots during replications)

1.0.0 initial commit to Github
