1.0.14 updated syncoid to reduce output when fetching snapshot list - thank you github user @0xFate. 

1.0.13 removed monitor_version again - sorry for the feature instability, forgot I removed it in the first place because I didn't like pulling
       in so many dependencies for such a trivial feature

1.0.12 patched default sanoid.conf provided to set yearly_mon and yearly_mday correctly

1.0.11 patched bug in yearly snapshots - thank you @stevenolen for the bug report!

1.0.10 added --monitor-version to check installed version against current version in trunk on GitHub

1.0.9 added CR/LF after --monitor-health message output to make CLI usage cleaner looking

1.0.8 added --version checking in sanoid and syncoid

1.0.7 got rid of unnecessary sudo commands in sanoid's --monitor-health

1.0.6 added 'or die' to make sure /var/cache/sanoidsnapshots.txt is writeable

1.0.5 fixed another ps BSD-ism bug in sanoid

1.0.4 updated ps usage in sanoid to comply with BSDisms

1.0.3 nerfed references to $debug (not implemented yet) in sanoid

1.0.2 implemented iszfsbusy check to the thinning routine in sanoid
